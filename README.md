# Project Overview

Helldivers 2, developed by a passionate team at Arrowhead Studios, has taken the gaming world by storm in 2024. With a development team of 100 creators, this title has become an instant hit among indie and mainstream audiences alike. Unlike many larger studios that may lose touch with their player base, Arrowhead Studios prides itself on creating games that they personally want to play and continuously listening to their community's feedback. This close interaction with players and commitment to quality has made Helldivers 2 not only a commercial success but also a beloved part of many gamers' libraries. The gameâ€™s design reflects a deep understanding of fun, challenge, and replayability, which are core to its widespread appeal.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to develop a tool that assists the developers in identifying and addressing issues that PC users experience while playing Helldivers 2 on Steam. This tool aims to enhance the gaming experience by ensuring high performance and engagement levels through continuous improvements based on player feedback.

## Key Features

- **Filterable Dates**: Allows the team to view issues from specific periods, helping pinpoint when certain problems started and track improvements over time.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: By analyzing the sentiment of user reviews and feedback, the tool highlights overall player mood and satisfaction, which is crucial for maintaining a positive community.
- **Issue Categorization**:
  - **Crashes**: Frequent crashes are a major deterrent for players, leading to frustration and disengagement. Identifying patterns in crash reports can help swiftly address these issues.
  - **Connectivity Issues**: Online gameplay is core to Helldivers 2, making stable connectivity paramount. The tool helps monitor and rectify connectivity complaints.
  - **Content Issues**: Feedback about repetitive content and a lack of variety can be used to guide new updates, including a wider range of missions and game modes to enhance replayability.
  - **Community and Social Interaction**: Engaging the community and fostering social interactions are key for an online game's longevity. Feedback in this category will be used to improve social features and community engagement strategies.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Utilized for scripting, data scraping, and calling the Steamworks API to gather real-time data and feedback from the Steam community.
- **Tableau**: Employed to visualize data and insights derived from the analysis, enabling the team to make informed decisions quickly and efficiently.
- **Apache Airflow**: Used for scheduling tasks, ensuring that data collection and analysis are performed consistently every week, keeping the feedback loop current and relevant.

The integration of these technologies ensures that the development team can remain agile and responsive to the community's needs, ultimately leading to a more enjoyable and robust gaming experience for all Helldivers 2 players.
